class BoxscorePlayer(AbstractPlayer):
    """
    Get player stats for an individual game.

    Given a player ID, such as 'BreeDr01' for Drew Brees, their full name, and
    all associated stats from the Boxscore page in HTML format, parse the HTML
    and extract only the relevant stats for the specified player and assign
    them to readable properties.

    This class inherits the ``AbstractPlayer`` class. As a result, all
    properties associated with ``AbstractPlayer`` can also be read directly
    from this class.

    As this class is instantiated from within the Boxscore class, it should not
    be called directly and should instead be queried using the appropriate
    players properties from the Boxscore class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id : string
        A player's ID according to pro-football-reference.com, such as
        'BreeDr00' for Drew Brees. The player ID can be found by navigating to
        the player's stats page and getting the string between the final slash
        and the '.htm' in the URL. In general, the ID is in the format
        'LlllFfNN' where 'Llll' are the first 4 letters in the player's last
        name with the first letter capitalized, 'Ff' are the first 2 letters in
        the player's first name where the first letter is capitalized, and 'NN'
        is a number starting at '00' for the first time that player ID has been
        used and increments by 1 for every successive player.
    player_name : string
        A string representing the player's first and last name, such as 'David
        Blough'.
    player_data : string
        A string representation of the player's HTML data from the Boxscore
        page. If the player appears in multiple tables, all of their
        information will appear in one single string concatenated together.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parsing_scheme : dict
        A dictionary of the parsing scheme to be used to find the desired
        field. The key corresponds to the attribute name to parse, and the
        value is a PyQuery-readable parsing scheme as a string (such as

    field : string
        The name of the attribute to match. Field must be a key in

    index : int (optional)
        An optional index if multiple fields have the same attribute name. For
        example, 'HR' may stand for the number of home runs a baseball team has
        hit, or the number of home runs a pitcher has given up. The index
        aligns with the order in which the attributes are recevied in the
        html_data parameter.
    strip : boolean (optional)
        An optional boolean value which will remove any empty or invalid
        elements which might show up during list comprehensions. Specify True
        if the invalid elements should be removed from lists, which can help
        with reverse indexing.
    secondary_index : int (optional)
        An optional index if multiple fields have the same attribute, but the
        original index specified above doesn't work. This happens if a page
        doesn't have all of the intended information, and the requested index
        isn't valid, causing the value to be None. Instead, a secondary index
